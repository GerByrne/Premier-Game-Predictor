Third Year Group Project/Thesis: (Premier Games Predictor).

This involved the development of a web app, named Premier Games Predictor, for the purpose of
providing forecasts on the results of upcoming English Premier League weekly football ?xtures.

To achieve a high degree of accuracy a formula, commonly used for chess tournaments, known as the
Elo rating system was implemented.

For my part in this project I designed and developed the website and oversaw its hosting. I also coded
and implemented the algorithm for the Elo rating which had to be amended to suit the various attributes
and weights associated with football. This algorithm was ?rst implemented in Java code before I recoded
it in PHP for better incorporation into the web app.

Other technologies and techniques utilised were HTML5, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, jQuery, the DOM and
UML.
